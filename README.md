# Slides for Numerical Methods
These are the LaTeX source files for my course Numerical Methods (6E5X0), at Eindhoven University of Technology. The course deals with various numerical techniques, highlighting examples and exercises in Matlab. Topics are numerical errors, integration, interpolation, (systems of) (non-)linear equations, ODEs and PDEs, and optimization.

Some initial commits were artificially set to an earlier (reasonable) commit date to allow for some chronological ordering/evolution of these files over the years. 

## Compilation
To compile simply use:

`python render.py <filename>`

Where the filename does not have to contain the extension. This will automatically open the resulting slide as well.
