  \begin{itemize}
    \item Object oriented programming: classes and objects
    \item Memory management: some programming languages require you to allocate computer memory yourself (e.g. for arrays)
    \item External libraries: in many cases, someone already built the general functionality you are looking for
    \item Compiling and scripting (``interpreted''); compiling means converting a program to computer-language before execution. Interpreted languages do this on the fly.
    \item Parallellization: Distributing expensive calculations over multiple processors or GPUs.
