 \frametitle{The following is a list with appearing items?}
 \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item Scientific techniques depend in an increasing fashion upon computer programs and simulation methods
  \item Knowledge of programming allows you to automate routine tasks 
  \item Ability to understand algorithms by inspection of the code 
  \item Learn to think by dissecting a problem into smaller, easier to solve, parts 
 \end{itemize}

 \begin{block}{What is a program?}
  \emph{A program is a sequence of instructions that is written to perform a certain task on a computer.} % SOURCE http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython002.html
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The computation might be something mathematical, a symbolic operation, image analysis, etc.%such as solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial
    \item It can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document 
    \item A program may even be used to compile another program
    \item A program consists of one or more \emph{algorithms}
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{block}{Program layout}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Input (Get the radius of a circle)
        \item Operations (Compute and store the area of the circle)
        \item Output (Print the area to the screen)

   Start Python, and enter the following commands on the command line. Evaluate the output.
   \pause
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,numbers=none]
>> 2 + 3        # Some simple calculations
>> 2 * 3

>> a = 2        # Storing values into the workspace
>> b = 3
>> c = (2 * 3)**2  # Parentheses set priority
>> 8 / a - b (*@ \pause @*)
>> import math  # Mathematical functions can be used 
>> math.sin(a)  
>> math.sin(0.5 * math.pi)  # math.pi is an internal Python variable
>> import cmath  # for working with complex numbers
>> cmath.sqrt(-1)  # ... as are imaginary numbers

 %% PRINTING
 \begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Printing and formatting results}
  In Python, you can control the display format of the output of a command using various formatting methods such as `str.format()`, f-strings, or by using formatting specifiers while printing with `print()`. These methods only involve changing the way the numbers are displayed, not the underlying representation.
  
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,numbers=none]
>> # Using str.format()
>> a = 19/4
>> print("{:.2f}".format(a)) # 2 decimal places
>> b = a**(-6)
>> print("{:.10f}".format(b)) # 10 decimal places
>> 
>> # Using f-strings (Python 3.6+)
>> c = (21)**0.5
>> print(f"{c:.10f}") # 10 decimal places
>> d = (2.71828)**(-c) 
>> print(f"{d:.2e}") # Scientific notation with 2 decimal places
>> 
>> # Using print formatting
>> print("{:.2f}".format(d)) # 2 decimal places
  \end{lstlisting}

  \frametitle{A slide without a logo}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Using the \keystroke{$\uparrow$} and \keystroke{$\downarrow$} keys, you can cycle through recent commands
    \item Typing part of a command and pressing \keystroke{Tab} completes the command and lists the possibilities
    \item If a computation takes too long, you can press \keystroke{Ctrl}+\keystroke{C} to stop the program and return to the command line. Note that you may end up with incomplete results in the workspace.
    \item Sequences of commands (programs, scripts) are contained as py-files, plain text files with the \lstinline$.py$ extension.
    \item Python scripts can also be contained in jupyter notebooks, which have extension \lstinline$.ipynb$.
    \item Such py-files must be in the \emph{current working directory} or in the Python \emph{path}, the locations where Python searches for a command. If you try to run a script that is not in the path, Python will throw an Exception/Error.
    \item Anything following a \lstinline$#$ symbol is regarded as a comment
    \item There are several keyboard shortcuts (vary with text editor) that will make coding much more efficient.
  \end{itemize}
